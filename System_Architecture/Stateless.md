## Overview of Stateless Architecture

Stateless architecture keeps application state (data) in a data store or user interface, not within application code.
Benefits include enhanced scalability and redundancy.
### Key Concepts

1. Scalability
- Resources can increase or decrease automatically based on system load.
- Scaling is seamless without disrupting ongoing operations.

2. Redundancy

- Ensures the system continues to operate even if one resource fails.
- Extra resources or servers can quickly replace malfunctioning ones, maintaining continuity.

### Stateless vs. Stateful Systems

#### Stateless Setup
- Each server processes requests independently.
- All servers access a common data store, allowing any server to serve any request without needing prior session data.
#### Stateful Setup Issues
- User session data is stored within individual servers.
- When a load balancer directs requests to different servers, user recognition errors can occur, resulting in a poor user experience.
### The Role of the Load Balancer

- Distributes incoming requests evenly across all available servers.
- Monitors server health and stops routing requests to any malfunctioning servers.
- Supports both scalability (adding/removing servers) and redundancy (ensuring continuous operation).
### Advantages of Stateless Architecture

- Scalability: New servers can be added or removed on-demand.
- Reliability: System remains operational even if a server fails.
- Improved User Experience: All servers share session data, eliminating recognition errors.
### Conclusion

Stateless architecture is critical for building scalable, reliable, and user-friendly systems.
Ensures smooth operation through scalability and redundancy, essential for modern application performance.
